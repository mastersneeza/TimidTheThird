Timid is a (small?) language
Why does it exist? I dunno.
Do I want it to exist? Maybe.
Can it become useful? Possibly.

## Features

- Arithmetic
- P R I N T I N G
- Simple types (int, float, bool, string, null)
- Control flow (why wouldn't it have it?)
- That's it

## Coming soon (or maybe never)

- Functions and lambdas
- Classes
- Better error handling
- String functions
- Imports and exports
- Collections (array, tuple, dictionary, stack)
- Remove semicolon delimitter
- Typing
